## Security Measures

### Current Implementation

#### Frontend

- **XSS Prevention**: Shadow DOM encapsulation
- **Content Security Policy**: To be implemented
- **Input Validation**: Basic validation in place
- **HTTPS**: Recommended for production

#### Backend

- **CORS**: Configured for development
- **Input Validation**: Needs enhancement
- **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented (needed for production)
- **Authentication**: Not implemented (planned)

### Known Limitations

The current version is a development/demo version with the following limitations:

1. **No Authentication**: Anyone can access all endpoints
2. **No Authorization**: No role-based access control
3. **No Rate Limiting**: Vulnerable to DoS attacks
4. **No Input Sanitization**: Limited input validation
5. **File-Based Storage**: Not suitable for production
6. **No Encryption**: Sensitive data not encrypted
7. **Development CORS**: Wide open for development

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

If you're deploying this application, please implement these security measures:

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

```javascript
// Implement JWT authentication
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

app.use('/api', (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
  }
});
```

### 2. Rate Limiting

```javascript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

### 3. Input Validation

```javascript
import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator';

app.post('/upload',
  body('*.email').isEmail(),
  body('*.name').trim().notEmpty(),
  (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    // Process request
  }
);
```

### 4. CORS Configuration

```javascript
import cors from 'cors';

app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(','),
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
}));
```

### 5. Helmet for Security Headers

```javascript
import helmet from 'helmet';

app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
}));
```

### 6. SQL Injection Prevention

```javascript
// Use parameterized queries
const query = 'SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE id = ?';
db.execute(query, [id]);
```

### 7. XSS Prevention

```javascript
import xss from 'xss';

// Sanitize user input
const sanitizedInput = xss(userInput);
```

### 8. Environment Variables

Never commit sensitive data. Use environment variables:

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/db
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### 9. HTTPS Only

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (req.header('x-forwarded-proto') !== 'https') {
      res.redirect(`https://${req.header('host')}${req.url}`);
    } else {
      next();
    }
  });
}
```

### 10. Database Security

- Use connection pooling
- Implement prepared statements
- Regular backups
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use read replicas for queries

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] Authentication implemented (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- [ ] Authorization and role-based access control
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Output sanitization (XSS prevention)
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Security headers (Helmet)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive info
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] File upload restrictions
- [ ] Regular security audits scheduled

## Dependency Security

### Audit Dependencies

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Force fix (may break things)
npm audit fix --force
```

### Keep Dependencies Updated

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update packages
npm update

# Update major versions (carefully)
npx npm-check-updates -u
npm install
```

### Monitor Dependencies

Use tools like:

- Dependabot (GitHub)
- Snyk
- npm audit
- OWASP Dependency-Check

## Common Vulnerabilities

### 1. SQL Injection

**Risk**: Currently using file-based storage (not vulnerable)
**Future**: Use parameterized queries when migrating to SQL

### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

**Risk**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Shadow DOM provides some protection, add CSP

### 3. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Risk**: High (no protection currently)
**Mitigation**: Implement CSRF tokens

### 4. Injection Attacks

**Risk**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs

### 5. Broken Authentication

**Risk**: High (no authentication currently)
**Mitigation**: Implement proper authentication

### 6. Sensitive Data Exposure

**Risk**: High (no encryption currently)
**Mitigation**: Encrypt sensitive data, use HTTPS

### 7. Broken Access Control

**Risk**: High (no authorization currently)
**Mitigation**: Implement role-based access control

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradicate**: Remove the vulnerability
4. **Recover**: Restore normal operations
5. **Review**: Post-incident analysis
6. **Notify**: Inform affected users (if required)
